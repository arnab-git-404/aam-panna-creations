    "I was feeling really tense and stressed when my last mentor couldn't start the sessions, and things weren't going as planned. But you have truly been like sunshine during this time, restoring my faith that I can do it with your guidance. I can't thank you enough for all the effort and support you've given me. Words may never be enough, but I'm genuinely grateful for you and everything you do. I understand that you're really busy, but I would love to have a long-term association with you as my mentor whenever you have the time. I'm always willing to learn and grow under your guidance. Also, Di, I do freelancing, mostly in content writing. If you ever come across any opportunities in the future, please do consider me.",
